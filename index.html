                        contains 4 special pictures, that each have a 'hidden star'. Each star represents a memory I
                        hold
                        dear
                        with my girlfriend. Moreover, each star has a fitting minigame that unlocks a special thanks

                        to

                        favorite
                        song is 'Yellow' from Coldplay. And I want to show in 4 sentences how much I appreciate her.
                        Together
                        with my Unity skills and creative mind, I wanted to do something special for our 2nd

                    <p class="p1 reveal" style="display: none;"><b>What is it?</b><br>A WebGL game in which the user
                        experiences multiple different
                        situations,
                        through the eyes of different people with autism. The game is based on the stories and
                        experiences of a variety of Defence personnel with autism. It is made in Unity and used by our
                        military.<br><br><b>The story</b><br>The Autism Experience Game is a discovery game focused on
                        the differences in perception between people with and without autism. Play unique scenarios that
                        allow you to experience the contrast between those two worlds. Reflect on your experiences, and
                        learn how to navigate them.<br><br><b>Why this game?</b><br>People with autism are at a high
                        risk of experiencing burnout, depression, and workplace absenteeism. Communication problems
                        (partly caused by a misunderstanding of autism) can lead to conflicts at work. Colleagues with
                        autism within the military often feel misunderstood. Their peers express that they do not know
                        how to handle certain situations.<br><br><b>After completion</b><br>The game was a succes, and
                        caused for many collegues to have a better understanding on the strenghts and difficulties
                        autism can give someone, but also on how to put those strenghts to good use. The game also
                        helped some people with autism to better talk about their insecurities or problems, and it even
                        played a role in getting our Ministry of Defence its own Autism Embassy.<br><br><b>My

                    <p class="p1 reveal2" style="display: none;"><b>What is it?</b><br>A team-based multimedia game in
                        which you gamble with our climate, by making everyday decisions. The goal is to polute and
                        destroy our Earth as fast as possible, by playing 4 different climate-related games.<br>The game
                        consists of physical props, minigames on a tablet, and animations + videofragments on a big
                        screen.<br><br><b>The story</b><br>The players enter a room in which multiple poker-like tables
                        are placed. In teams of 5, they gamble with emmission-coins and try to destroy the Earth as a
                        team. The team who has the most emmision-coins at the end of the game, wins.<br><br><b>Why this
                            game?</b><br>It is a unique approach in the attempt to get the holy grail: long-term
                        behavioural change. My research showed that creating awareness by learning from our everyday
                        harmfull behaviour, actually shocked some testers of the game-MVP. The game triggers you to do
                        the wrong thing, by overstimulating you with rewards (emmission-coins), light and casino-sounds.
                        It serves an important role and has a methaphorical connection to our way of living, as in an
                        addiction. The game starts fun and relatively fast-pased (higly rewarding), but ends in a state
                        where the players get confronted with the consequences of their actions.<br><br><b>After
                            completion</b><br>I finished my ICT education with honors, and my manager was happy with the
                        results. The game was partually delivered as an MPV and prototype.<br><br><b>My competences</b>

                        emission-points. I made the system and implemented it into the game, with Arduino IDE and Unity.

                        two starting designers (me as well) and three starting technology students. Bottle Stop was

                        bottles with RFID chips on the bottom, that are read by Bottle Stop stations. Only with this

                        stations.<br><br>With our project, we reached the semi-finals of the ICTalent Awards. But
                        because of
                        COVID, the Talent-Awards got scrapped off the agenda and we couldn't continue anymore.<br><br>My

                    made
                    in Unity with ARCore, and Vuforia.<br><br><b>The story</b><br>This photobook is no ordinary
                    book. It
                    contains 4 special pictures, that each have a 'hidden star'. Each star represents a memory I
                    hold
                    dear
                    with my girlfriend. Moreover, each star has a fitting minigame that unlocks a special thanks
                    from me
                    to
                    her after completion. <br><br><b>Why this book?</b><br>My girlfriend likes photography. Her
                    favorite
                    song is 'Yellow' from Coldplay. And I want to show in 4 sentences how much I appreciate her.
                    Together
                    with my Unity skills and creative mind, I wanted to do something special for our 2nd
                    anniversary.</p>

                <p class="MCp1AEG" style="display: none;"><b>What is it?</b><br>A WebGL game in which the user
                    experiences multiple different
                    situations,
                    through the eyes of different people with autism. The game is based on the stories and
                    experiences of a variety of Defence personnel with autism. It is made in Unity and used by our
                    military.<br><br><b>The story</b><br>The Autism Experience Game is a discovery game focused on
                    the differences in perception between people with and without autism. Play unique scenarios that
                    allow you to experience the contrast between those two worlds. Reflect on your experiences, and
                    learn how to navigate them.<br><br><b>Why this game?</b><br>People with autism are at a high
                    risk of experiencing burnout, depression, and workplace absenteeism. Communication problems
                    (partly caused by a misunderstanding of autism) can lead to conflicts at work. Colleagues with
                    autism within the military often feel misunderstood. Their peers express that they do not know
                    how to handle certain situations.<br><br><b>After completion</b><br>The game was a succes, and
                    caused for many collegues to have a better understanding on the strenghts and difficulties
                    autism can give someone, but also on how to put those strenghts to good use. The game also
                    helped some people with autism to better talk about their insecurities or problems, and it even
                    played a role in getting our Ministry of Defence its own Autism Embassy.<br><br><b>My

                    which you gamble with our climate, by making everyday decisions. The goal is to polute and
                    destroy our Earth as fast as possible, by playing 4 different climate-related games.<br>The game
                    consists of physical props, minigames on a tablet, and animations + videofragments on a big
                    screen.<br><br><b>The story</b><br>The players enter a room in which multiple poker-like tables
                    are placed. In teams of 5, they gamble with emmission-coins and try to destroy the Earth as a
                    team. The team who has the most emmision-coins at the end of the game, wins.<br><br><b>Why this
                        game?</b><br>It is a unique approach in the attempt to get the holy grail: long-term
                    behavioural change. My research showed that creating awareness by learning from our everyday
                    harmfull behaviour, actually shocked some testers of the game-MVP. The game triggers you to do
                    the wrong thing, by overstimulating you with rewards (emmission-coins), light and casino-sounds.
                    It serves an important role and has a methaphorical connection to our way of living, as in an
                    addiction. The game starts fun and relatively fast-pased (higly rewarding), but ends in a state
                    where the players get confronted with the consequences of their actions.<br><br><b>After
                        completion</b><br>I finished my ICT education with honors, and my manager was happy with the
                    results. The game was partually delivered as an MPV and prototype.<br><br><b>My competences</b>
