                        destroy our Earth as fast as possible, by playing 4 different climate-related games.<br>The game
                        consists of physical props, minigames on a tablet, and animations + videofragments on a big
                        screen.<br><br><b>The story</b><br>The players enter a room in which multiple poker-like tables
                        are placed. In teams of 5, they gamble with emmission-coins and try to destroy the Earth as a
                        team. The team who has the most emmision-coins at the end of the game, wins.<br><br><b>Why this
                            game?</b><br>It is a unique approach in the attempt to get the holy grail: long-term
                        behavioural change. My research showed that creating awareness by learning from our everyday
                        harmfull behaviour, actually shocked some testers of the game-MVP. The game triggers you to do
                        the wrong thing, by overstimulating you with rewards (emmission-coins), light and casino-sounds.
                        It serves an important role and has a methaphorical connection to our way of living, as in an
                        addiction. The game starts fun and relatively fast-pased (higly rewarding), but ends in a state
                        where the players get confronted with the consequences of their actions.<br><br><b>After
                            completion</b><br>I finished my ICT education with honors, and my manager was happy with the
                        results. The game was partually delivered as an MPV and prototype.<br><br><b>My competences</b>

                Unity with ARCore, and Vuforia.<br><br><b>The story</b><br>This photobook is no ordinary book. It
                contains 4 special pictures, that each have a 'hidden star'. Each star represents a memory I hold dear
                with my girlfriend. Moreover, each star has a fitting minigame that unlocks a special thanks from me to
                her after completion. <br><br><b>Why this book?</b><br>My girlfriend likes photography. Her favorite
                song is 'Yellow' from Coldplay. And I want to show in 4 sentences how much I appreciate her. Together
                with my Unity skills and creative mind, I wanted to do something special for our 2nd
                anniversary.<br><br><i>Hover over the video to play.</i></p> -->
